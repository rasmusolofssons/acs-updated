# Automatic Campaign Switcher #

## About ##
This project is originally made by Chris P from AlliedModders https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=1463891.
This is a plugin written in SourcePawn (Pawn) https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Introduction_to_SourcePawn_1.7.
The plugin is used in the game Left4Dead2 made by Valve. What the plugin does is to automatically switch to a random (or voted by players) new campaign when the current campaign ends.
Dedicated servers normally kicks out all the players out of the server at the end of a campaign. This plugin solves that.
What I have done here is to simply add missing campaigns for the Versus mode that has been added after Chris P stopped updating the plugin.
